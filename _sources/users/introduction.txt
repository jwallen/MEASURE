**MEASURE** - short for **M**\ aster **E**\ quation **A**\ utomatic **S**\ olver 
for **U**\ nimolecular **RE**\ actions - is a tool for estimating 
pressure-dependent phenomenological rate coefficients :math:`k(T,P)` for  
unimolecular reaction networks of arbitrary complexity. The approach is to
first generate a detailed model of the reaction network using the 
one-dimensional master equation, then apply one of several available model 
reduction methods of varying accuracy, speed, and robustness to simplify the 
detailed model into a set of phenomenological rate coefficients. The result 
is a set of :math:`k(T,P)` functions suitable for use in chemical reaction
mechanisms.

About MEASURE
=============

MEASURE was originally developed by Joshua W. Allen under the tutelage of
`Prof. William H. Green <http://web.mit.edu/greengp/>`_ in the 
`Department of Chemical Engineering <http://web.mit.edu/cheme/>`_ at the 
`Massachusetts Institute of Technology <http://web.mit.edu/>`_. Its original 
purpose was to be a component of the automatic reaction mechanism generation
software `RMG <http://rmg.sourceforge.net/>`_. Since then it has also been 
adapted as a standalone package useful for investigating individual reaction 
networks in greater detail.

MEASURE is written in the `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ programming
language to facilitate ease of development, installation, and use. Certain
computationally-intensive procedures have been adapted to the
`Cython <http://www.cython.org/>`_ programming language in order to improve the
execution time.
