The following is a reference to the application programming interface (API) 
used within MEASURE. If you are a developer wishing to know the full 
implementation details of MEASURE - e.g. if you are trying to modify the 
codebase - this document is for you. If you are simply trying to learn how to
generate phenomenological rate coefficients with MEASURE, you should switch to
the :ref:`usersguide`. If you want to know the mathematical basis for the
master equation methods used by measure, you should read the :ref:`theory`.
(In fact, if you haven't already, you may wish to read these documents first 
before continuing.)

The source for MEASURE is split across a number of Python and Cython modules. 
Each section of the developers' guide references a different module:

=========================== ====================================================
Module                      Description
=========================== ====================================================
:mod:`measure.input`        Reading network data from input files
:mod:`measure.network`      Representing network data in memory
:mod:`measure.collision`    Working with collision models and parameters
:mod:`measure.reaction`     Working with microcanonical and phenomenological rate coefficients
:mod:`measure.msc`          Determining :math:`k(T,P)` via the modified strong collision method
:mod:`measure.rs`           Determining :math:`k(T,P)` via the reservoir state method
:mod:`measure.output`       Writing network data to input and output files
:mod:`measure.settings`     Setting application-wide options
